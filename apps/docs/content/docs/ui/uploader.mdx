## Usage
<MdxTip>For demonstration purposes, we will limit the file size to under **100MB** for all the examples below. In real-world usage, you can increase this limit as needed.</MdxTip>

<ComponentPreview name="UploaderDemo" className="max-w-[500px] mx-auto" />

## Custom Upload Action
There are situations where you may need to customize the Uploader's action:
- You might want to add headers to the request or handle the backend response.
- You need to perform some operations before uploading, such as obtaining a presigned URL.

To customize the upload action, you can extend and override the methods of the `UploaderAction` class. Alternatively, 
you can directly edit the `UploaderAction` class as it's part of your own codebase.
<ComponentPreview name="UploaderCustom" className="max-w-[500px] mx-auto" />

## Retry on Upload Failure
This demo shows how the retry button looks and works. We've intentionally used an endpoint that always returns an error,
try uploading a file to see the retry feature in action.

## What is Form Management?

Form management is a critical aspect of modern web applications, handling user input, validation, and data submission. This guide covers everything you need to know about building robust, user-friendly forms using **React Hook Form** and **Zod**.

## Rethinking Validation
You might be used to placing all validation logic directly within the form declaration like this, but in this guide, we'll take a different approach:
```tsx
const form = useForm({
    // We won't handle validation this way
    resolver: zodResolver(z.object({
        email: z.string(),
        password: z.string()
    })),
  })
```
Placing all validation logic inside your form can lead to several issues:
- Your field validation logic and your field UI rendering are separated. You have to look in more than one place to understand the complete logic for a field.
- It's difficult to handle conditional validation, such as when a field's validation depends on the value of another field (yes, you could use `refine`, but your schema will become overly complex).
- Dynamically enabling or disabling validation for certain fields is challenging. For instance, if you conditionally hide a field, its validation still be enforced.

Validating at the form level is only suitable for simple forms. In most real-world projects, forms inevitably become more complex, so we've chosen to standardize validation at the field level instead.

In React Hook Form, you can perform field-level validation using the `rules` API, which offers basic rules like `min`, `max`, and `validate`. However, there isn’t a built-in way to directly use Zod for individual fields. 
To address this, we’ve extended Zod to work seamlessly at the field level. You can see how this is implemented in: `packages/lib/src/validation/index.ts`.

And when it comes to validation, we use a single, consistent approach:
```tsx
import { z } from '@workspace/lib/validation'

<FormField
    name="email"
    rules={{ validate: z.string().validateFn() }}
    ...
/>
```

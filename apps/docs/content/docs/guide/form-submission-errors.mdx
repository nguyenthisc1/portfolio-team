description: Handle server-side submission errors and map them to fields.

## Usage
Submission errors generally fall into two categories: field-specific errors and general form errors. Hereâ€™s a common approach to display both types:
- For field-specific errors, use `setSubmitErrors`.
- For general form errors, simply display a toast message.
<ComponentPreview name="RecFormSubmissionErrors" className="max-w-[350px] mx-auto" />

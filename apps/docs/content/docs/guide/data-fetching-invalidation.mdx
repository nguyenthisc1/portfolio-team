## What does `invalidate query` mean in TanStack Query?

In TanStack Query, to `invalidate a query` means marking a cached query as stale so that it will be refetched the next time it is used. This helps ensure your application's data stays up to date after a mutation or relevant change.

## Just invalidate everything

Honestly, the easiest approach to ensure your UI reflects server changes is to just invalidate all queries:
```tsx
queryClient.invalidateQueries()
```
It’s understandable to think this could be inefficient, and in certain situations that’s true, but for most applications, the simplicity and reliability are worth it. 
You don’t have to micromanage individual `queryKey`s, and your UI will remain accurate and up to date everywhere.

If you try to fine‑grain invalidation, you must know every place a piece of data is used. For example, 
mutating a category that’s also referenced by posts and filters means you must track 
and invalidate all relevant query keys. That’s tedious and error‑prone. 
Invalidating everything is often the pragmatic choice.

Another real-world example is Remix.run, a major React framework, which also invalidates all data after any mutation, 
and you can't even change this behavior.

## What if I do need fine‑grained invalidation?
There are cases where you want precision. In our Next.js or Vite apps, look at `shared/components/Providers.tsx`, we set sensible defaults for TanStack Query:
```tsx
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
        queries: {
            retry: 1,
            refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
            staleTime: 1000 * 60,
        },
    },
    mutationCache: new MutationCache({
        onSuccess: async (_data, _variables, _context, mutation) => {
            await queryClient.invalidateQueries({
                predicate: query =>
                    // invalidate all matching tags at once
                    // or everything if no meta is provided
                    (mutation.meta?.invalidates as any)?.some((queryKey: any) => matchQuery({ queryKey }, query)) ??
                    true,
            })
        },
    }),
})
```
By default, we invalidate after every mutation. If you want a mutation to be an exception and manage invalidation yourself, provide a `meta` field with the keys to invalidate, for example:
```tsx
useMutation({
  mutationFn: updateLabel,
  meta: {
    invalidates: [['issues'], ['labels']],
  },
})
```

## Summary
Begin with broad query invalidation for ease and reliability, and introduce fine-grained targeting only when necessary for your app’s requirements.
